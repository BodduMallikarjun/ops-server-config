# ops-server-config

The **Operations Server Configuration** is a collection of Python scripts and batch files that automate the installation of 
the ArcGIS platform on Windows machines and the publication of Portal for ArcGIS content and ArcGIS for Server services. 
While developed for an implementation of the ArcGIS Platform with a specific software configuration and content (i.e. _Operations Server_), 
the scripts can be modified to meet your requirements.

The goals of the scripts are to:

* Automate the software installation and configuration process as much as possible.
* Ensure a consistent and repeatable process.
* Reduce the time necessary to install software and deploy content.
* Simplify the complete portal deployment of Esriâ€™s Military and Intelligence solution.
